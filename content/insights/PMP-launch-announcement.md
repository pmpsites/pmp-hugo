**Clarity**, the inward investment marketing specialists, and **Diva Creative**, the full-service creative agency, have announced the launch of Place Marketing Partners, providing a comprehensive, strategic place marketing solution for clients including local authorities, regional agencies, developers and strategic economic development projects.

**Place Marketing Partners** builds on the expertise and track record of both companies in delivering place marketing services, both independently and in partnership. 

Nick Smillie, Managing Director and senior consultant at **Clarity**, said: 

"Our experience and research has shown that place marketing is complex and challenging. Success involves managing a range of stakeholders and appealing to multiple audiences, including investing businesses and potential residents. They need place propositions that respond to their very different needs, all under a coherent and credible place brand identity."

"As well as specialist knowledge, success requires a strategic approach encompassing high-quality location data; persuasive, creative content; and targeted communications - to achieve clearly defined goals. Together, Clarity and Diva have the range of expertise required to deliver measurable success for our clients.” 

Amanda Pearce, Director at **Diva Creative**, said:

"Diva specialises in creative content and communications to influence behaviour, including the places people choose to live, work or visit. Clarity focuses on strategic, data-driven approaches to attracting investing businesses and the talented people they need for success."

"Together we have the expertise to manage complex partnership projects, address the full range of place marketing audiences, and develop powerful place brands using outstanding creative content." 

Working separately or together, Clarity and Diva have delivered place marketing services for a range of clients and projects in the UK including Blackpool, Lincolnshire, Bicester Garden Town, Sheffield City Region, \[South Yorkshire?] and Central Bedfordshire. 

The launch of the Place Marketing Partners brand and service marks the formal integration of their place marketing offer. According to Amanda Pearce:

"Through Place Marketing Partners, we're offering a fully integrated place marketing service with a single contract and point of contact, but drawing on the combined expertise of two specialist teams, that combined have ambitions to be an unstoppable force in the Place Marketing space. 

"Between us, we offer a unique range of capabilities to help our customers communicate their location’s distinctive advantages and achieve ambitious place marketing goals."
